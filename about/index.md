I am currently a fifth-year graduate student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://ece.rice.edu) at [Rice University](http://rice.edu). My research interests lie in designing high-speed analog/ RF/ millimeter-wave integrated circuits, and I work under the guidance of [Aydin Babakhani](http://ece.rice.edu/~ab28/){:target="_blank"}.

In my spare time, I enjoy hacking circuits and reading about the challenging problems of physics. You'll often find me building/ rebuilding/ modifying/ hacking/ destroy existing electronic systems to make them do something it was not originally intended to. An admirer of Nature and its laws and hence a keen Physicist. Love to observe and engage in intellectual and metaphorical discussions.

I've always been a musical person; I play amateur electric guitar and love listening to soft, psychedelic and ghazals.
