I am currently a fifth-year graduate student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://ece.rice.edu){:target="_blank"} at [Rice University](http://rice.edu){:target="_blank"}. My research interests lie in designing high-speed analog/RF/millimeter-wave integrated circuits, and I work under the guidance of [Aydin Babakhani](http://ece.rice.edu/~ab28/){:target="_blank"}.

In my leisure, I enjoy hacking circuits and reading about the challenging problems of physics. I like to mess around with new technologies. You'll often find me building/rebuilding/modifying/hacking/destroy existing electronic systems to make them do something it was not originally intended to. 

An admirer of Nature and its laws and hence a keen Physicist. Love to observe and engage in intellectual and metaphorical discussions. A coffee enthusiast in search of a perfect cup, so if you know of a good place for coffee, hit me up!

I've always been a musical person; I play amateur electric guitar and love listening to soft psychedelic music with solos. Obsessed with car and planes, in the process of modifying my new RC car and soon to become an armature pilot.
