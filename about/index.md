I am currently a fifth-year graduate student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://ece.rice.edu){:target="_blank"} at [Rice University](http://rice.edu){:target="_blank"}. My research interests lie in designing high-speed analog/RF/millimeter-wave integrated circuits, and I work under the guidance of [Aydin Babakhani](http://ece.rice.edu/~ab28/){:target="_blank"}.

In my leisure, I enjoy hacking circuits and reading about the challenging problems of physics. I like to mess around with new technologies. You'll often find me building/rebuilding/modifying/hacking/destroy existing electronic systems to make them do something it was not originally intended to. 

An admirer of Nature and its laws and hence a keen Physicist. Love to observe and engage in intellectual and metaphorical discussions. A little peckish for knowledge and adventure!

I've always been a musical person; I play amateur electric guitar and love listening to soft psychedelic music with solos (can't get enough of Pink Flody). A bookworm, try to read atlest a book a month from all walks of genre. Obsessed with cars and planes, in the process of modifying my new RC car and soon to become an armature pilot. A coffee enthusiast in search of a perfect cup, so if you know of a good place for coffee, hit me up!
