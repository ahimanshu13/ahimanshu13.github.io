title: "About me"
---
I am currently a fourth-year graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice University. My research interests lie in designing high-speed analog/RF/millimeter-wave integrated circuits, and I work under the guidance of Aydin Babakhani.
<br>
In my spae time, I enjoy hacking circuits and reading about the challenging problems of physics. You will often find me building/re-building/modifying /hacking/destroy existing electronic systems to make them do something it was not originally intended to. Being am an admirer of Nature and its laws and hence a keen Physicist, I love to observe and engage in intellectual and metaphorical discussions.

I have always been a musical person; I play amateur electric guitar and love listening to soft, psychedelic and ghazals
