My Research work focuses on analysis, design, and testing of integrated circuits and systems with applications in high-speed secure wireless links, pulse-based radar, THz security imaging and medical monitoring.

### _Ultra-Wideband Time-Transfer_


### _Ultra-wideband Pulse-based Directional Modulation_
Ultra-wideband Pulse-based Directional Modulation is used for used for secure communication and precission localization.

### _Hi-speed Analog to Digital Coverter_
A high-speed analog to digital (ADC) is developed in 45nm CMOS technology. The architecuture uses Active Cancellation to mitigate the parasitic leakages in a transmission gate and increase the isolation. This increased isolation increases the preformance of ADCs.
 
(A 40GS/s Track-and-Hold amplifier with active cancellation capability is presented to mitigate the effect of leakage in transmission gate during the holding mode. A single-ended RF input signal is converted to a differential signal that feeds the active cancellation network. A record SFDR3 of 62dB with 40GS/s and 5GHz input frequency is reported in 45nm CMOS SOI. A droop voltage of 20Î¼v/ns is measured. An isolation of 32dB at 1GHz between the holding and tracking modes is recorded.)
