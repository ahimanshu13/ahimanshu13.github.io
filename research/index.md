### Ultra-wideband Pulse-based Directional Modulation

Ultra-wideband Pulse-based Directional Modulation is used for used for secure communication and precission localization. The driving vision of this project is to develop the foundations for realizing hardware layer security in next-generation highly-directional high-data-rate wireless networks. We propose _spatial encoding_ as a technique that produces useful and decodable information only at a desired location in space. Thwarting this adversary will broadly enhance security features spanning from privacy to prevention of unauthorized access to physical resources.

(A new techniques for ultra- wideband joint spatial coding is introduced in order to establish a secure line- of-sight (LOS) wireless communication link, performing precision localization of point objects, and generating high-resolution images from complex scenes. In the proposed technique, symbol generation and coding are jointly performed by multiple widely spaced transmitters. This method enables the transmission of directionally-modulated signals that can only be decoded at a desired angle, resulting in a secure communication link. It is also shown that joint spatial coding by multiple transmitters that are synchronized with each other enables the precise localization of multiple point objects and allows high-resolution 3-dimensional imaging of distributed objects. The technique is demonstrated experimentally in the frequency range 3–10GHz by generating and detecting ultra-wideband pulses.)

### Hi-speed Analog to Digital Coverter

A high-speed analog to digital (ADC) is developed in 45nm CMOS technology. The architecuture uses Active Cancellation to mitigate the parasitic leakages in a transmission gate and increase the isolation. This increased isolation increases the preformance of ADCs. A patent has been granted on the underline IP.
 
(A 40GS/s Track-and-Hold amplifier with active cancellation capability is presented to mitigate the effect of leakage in transmission gate during the holding mode. A single-ended RF input signal is converted to a differential signal that feeds the active cancellation network. A record SFDR3 of 62dB with 40GS/s and 5GHz input frequency is reported in 45nm CMOS SOI. A droop voltage of 20μv/ns is measured. An isolation of 32dB at 1GHz between the holding and tracking modes is recorded.)
