I'm Ankit. I am a graduate student in the [Computer Science Department at University of Texas at Austin](http://cs.utexas.edu). I like to mess around with new technologies.  My interests are in automation, systems and web apps. I like to create
things.

I like to play soccer, listen to music, play [Age of
Empires](http://store.steampowered.com/app/239550/); you know normal stuff. I watch way too
much TV and like to read about new technologies. I am a coffee addict in search of a perfect coffee. So if you know of a
good place for coffee, hit me up!


I like to learn languages. Puedo hablar [Español](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language), [हिन्दी ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi) and [ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_language). I'd like
to learn **French** better and **Mandarin Chinese**.
